# Chrome-extension-with-Javascript
A chrome extension that I made while studying Javascript

The "Links for later" extension, is able to save actual urls in a list, so the user can access them later
It can save any link inserted in the input filed or save the link of the current page
For a matter security the "Delete all" button only works with double clicks

I've plans to improve this extension in the future.
